# Hot-Pockets

Hot-Pockets is the winner of the University of Bristol's Computer Science Society's "Urban Air Mobility" Hack-a-thon 2020.

What is Hot-Pockets?
--------------------
Hot-Pockets is a unity based weather simulation which enables more efficient routing of autonomous air vehicles around a city.

In the project the engine power use of a drone which takes the shortest path and a drone which makes use of the natural pheonomenas of ridge lift and thermal columns are monitored.

What are "Hot pockets"?
------------------
Hot pockets is a euphamism for thermal columns (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thermal), in which a large areas of ground absorb heat from the sun and release it throughout the day. As they do so they create columns of warm air which air vehicles (most commonly gliders) are able to use to gain height efficiently. The simulation takes into account these hot objects and radiates heat throughout the system. These objects give free lift to any vehicle inside them.

Why simulate wind?
------------------
Wind is also simulated due to the phenomena known as ridge lift (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ridge_lift). This allows the air vehicle to take advantage of wind blowing at large vertical structures such as skyscrapers.
